This package provides an [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) component and primitive for rendering three-dimensional text using [Troika's text renderer](https://github.com/protectwise/troika/tree/master/packages/troika-three-text).

It has similar performance and quality to A-Frame's built-in SDF `text` component, but brings some additional advantages:

* It reads font files directly (ttf, otf, woff) and does not require using an external tool to pre-generate SDF textures with the glyphs you think you'll need.

* It supports ligatures so you can use fonts like [Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/).

* Rather than using a fully custom shader, it patches the built-in Three.js material shaders as needed, so you don't lose all the nice standard shader features like lighting and fog.

* Support for right-to-left/bidirectional language layout and shaping of Arabic text.


### API

This package registers both a _component_ (`<a-entity troika-text="value:Hello" />`) and a _primitive_ (`<a-troika-text value="Hello"></a-troika-text>`). Use whichever is most convenient for you.

I've attempted to keep the API as close as possible to that of A-Frame's default [text component](https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/text.html) and [a-text primitive](https://aframe.io/docs/master/primitives/a-text.html), however some things don't quite map exactly.

Note: It does not currently follow how the built-in `text` component interacts with a `geometry` component for auto-sizing and anchoring. I think that's a nice feature so it's probably worth adding; in the meantime just use the `maxWidth` and `anchor`/`baseline` attributes to control it manually.

#### Changing the material

By default the text will render using a `MeshBasicMaterial` using the `color` property described in the table above. But you can also change the material to gain more advanced shader features such as physically-based lighting.

If you are using the `<a-troika-text>` _primitive_, you can assign it a [`material` component](https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/material.html) just as you would any other entity.

```html
<a-troika-text
  value="Hello!"
  material="shader: standard; metalness: 0.8;"
></a-troika-text>
```

If you are using the `troika-text="..."` _component_, you must instead give it a `troika-text-material="..."` attribute to distinguish the text material from the entity's main material. You can pass it anything supported by the built in [`material` component](https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/material.html).

```html
<a-entity
  troika-text="value: Hello!"
  troika-text-material="shader: standard; metalness: 0.8;"
></a-entity>
```
